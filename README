The task:

Back-end Developer Challenge

Design and implement a system that will accept a multipart form upload
(say, containing an audio file) while displaying a percentage
progress.

The basic HTML design should look like:

Display form with file input field
Display a title text field
Display a status text paragraph "select file"
Optionally display a submit button

Specification:

When the user picks a file from their computer and the form is submitted, the
upload begins.
While uploading, the status text paragraph should be updating with the current
percentage complete at least once every 2 seconds.
While uploading, the user should be able to enter text into the title text field.

When the upload completes, the status text should display the path on the server
to the saved file, and the current value of the title text field should be
posted to the server. The response to the form post request should display both
the title and the path to the file.

Requirements:

The upload should honor proxy settings on the browser
The system must function behind a firewall that blocks all but port 80
The server must support at least 2 concurrent uploads from different users
Any technology that can be web deployed to IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome
(iPad/iPhone is optional) on any platform is supported

Homework:

There's a lot of file upload handling code and examples out there, especiall for the frontend part.
Here's a list:

Flash based frontend libraries:

Here's a good list of non-flash options:

There are also two complete challenge solutions to be found:

  * https://github.com/rngtng/FileUploadProgress
  * https://github.com/betten/SoundCloud-Developer-Challenge

For the backend, there are some Java Based ones (there's one from the apache project), lots of PHP
hacks, and you could always roll your own.
